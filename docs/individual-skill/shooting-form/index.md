Midtown teaches 4 basic components of good shot form:

Square and balanced - hips square to pasket and weight even distributed on feet

Elbow Away - Shooting arm at 90 degree and raising away from the body, not pinched like a chicken wing. Point elbow at rim while raising up arm for better aim.

Through the Window - Raising shooting arm created natural "window" to see the basket in a straight line.  Do not look over the ball by positioning ball under chin before shooting or look around the side of the ball by tilting head. 

Snap through and Thumbs up - Shooting hand lets middle and index finger roll off ball last while wrist snaps down. Opposite palm is resting lightly on side of ball and thumb points to ceiling as ball is released for clear path.
