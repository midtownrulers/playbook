### **5 Main Pillars to Become a Lockdown On Ball Basketball Defender**

https://ctghoops.com/5-steps-to-become-a-lockdown-on-ball-defender-for-basketball-defense/

1. Basketball Defense Stance

   1. Nose ABOVE Toes
   2. Arms wide
   3. Feet shoulder width
   4. Butt down, head up
2. Push NOT pull
3. Glass Ceiling

   1. Coffee mug - The third biggest fundamental of on ball defense is the glass ceiling. A lot of coaches like to call this the coffee mug.

      Visualize yourself getting into a defensive stance. Now imagine a glass ceiling right above your head once you get into your stance. The goal on defense is to NOT shatter the glass ceiling.

      This is an awesome analogy for kids to understand because they do not want to break the glass. If your bobbing up and down on defense constantly, your reflexes and reactions to certain situations are going to be much slower.

      Another way to think of this analogy is the coffee mug that I stated earlier. Once you get into your defensive stance, think of a hot coffee mug right on top of your head.

      The coffee mug also helps encourage a proper pillar one of on ball basketball defense: Stance.

      If the coffee mug is on top of your head, you most certainly can not have your nose past your toes!
