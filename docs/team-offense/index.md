It's more important to teach players "how to play" than to memorize a bunch of plays they'll either forget or won't be in a situation to execute.  

That said, MIdtown runs **4-1 Pass and Cut** and a **3-2 Hi Lo** half court sets.  These are two basic sets that players will see in middle and high school.

In addition - and more importantly - players will learn basic 2 and 3-man motions (give and go, pick and roll, off ball screening) that they can run independently with their teammates during the flow of the game.
