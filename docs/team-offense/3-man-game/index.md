3 Man basketball is ideal for teaching cutting, catching, and screening/rolling.  Its much easier to coach good hard cuts with 3 because to get open players will have to move.  

Important to teach planting foot and pushing off to cut explosively with hands out to catch.  Passer must complete strong pass and then cut to basket with hand up ready to catch and shoot
