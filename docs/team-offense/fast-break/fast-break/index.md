title: 3 Man Break No Dribble
---
SETUP:

3 players spread apart on baseline, Middle player has ball. 

Middle starts with outlet pass to Wing moving down sideline, then Wing passes back to Middle, who then passes up the court to Opposite Wing who is flying down the opposite baseline to the basket.

Players should execute without any dribbling, except for perhaps one at the very end by the shooter going up for a layup.  This requires, timing, spacing and strong passing.

Players go down and then back and next group of 3 players step up.

Challenge team to complete 5 baskets in a row.
