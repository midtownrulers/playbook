title: Fast Break
---
Middle and high school ball has tons of turnovers, and many scoring opportunities are created  as the Offense comes across the half court and is pressured early by the Defense to give up the ball, creating the fast break. In addition, after a missed shot attempt by the Offense, it's important for the Defense to secure the rebound and immediately look down court for release.  

Stress teamwork - driving down middle to force defender to commit to ball handler and then dish to wing player also running the floor.  Also stress 'trailer' - another player following the break down the court can be another outlet or rebounder for any missed attempt.
