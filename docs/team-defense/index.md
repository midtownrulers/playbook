Midtown focuses on 2 types of Zone Defense - 2/3 Basic Shell and 3/2 Aggressive Shell.  These are to be used later in the season after all players have demonstrated solid individual defensive fundamentals and have already learned to communicate on switches adequately.

Zone Defenses are a common middle-school defensive scheme and can be effective, but many times the defense isn't executed well and leads to sagging defenders and easy shots.
