title: 3-2 Zone
---
3-2 Zone puts a aggressive "Chaser" at the top of the key to meet the ball hander as they come across midcourt and pressure to the sideline or to pass off to wing.  They are to stunt on drives bur recover back to top of key to prevent easy resets. Chaser is most active in the zone defense

2 Wing defenders trap off the pressure from the Chaser and stunt inside to attack the post areas while contesting outside shots.

2 Post Defenders:

* Low Post boxes out weak side and looks for pass off from drives - must be physical and isolate main big underneath.
*  High post prevents offense 4/5 from setting up on foul line and contests ball side attack drives
